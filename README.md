# Orbio bit field

Animated 0101 grid for Orbio backgrounds. The tinted cells stay fixed; only the 0s and 1s change.

- **Fields:** Stone (background base), Vein, Celeste, Brass, Void (dark), Vein CTA (calm centre for a headline)
- **Motion:** Flicker, Wave, Stream; the pointer stirs nearby digits
- **Keys:** `H` hides the controls (for screen recording), `Space` pauses
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (opens paused)

Grid: 40px cells, Geist Mono 20px digits, one tint level per cell. Every row spells "ORBIO " in 8-bit ASCII.
At 1920×1080 it matches the Figma masters cell for cell (ASSETS → "BIT FIELD" in the ORBIO file).
The field data comes from `tools/patterns/bitfield.py` in the brand project.

Static single file: `index.html`, no build step.

## Protocol hero mockup

`protocol-hero/` is a mockup of the orbio.so/protocol hero on a dimmed 20px bit field. Text blocks knock the field out on whole cells; the marble hand holding CREDIT leads. The Void and Marble variants toggle bottom-right (`H` hides the switch).

The headline is outlined from ABC Arizona Flare (Dinamo trial). License it before production use.
